# Hello, world!
## Sharing my JS studies (for begginers)

## JavaScript

- JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. It is a interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before executing. It is also a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports different programming styles;
- JavaScript is weakly typed, which means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types. For example, a variable can be used to hold a string, then a number, and then a boolean;
- JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects;
- There are three types os variables in JavaScript: `var`, `let` and `const`. The `var` keyword (not so used after ES6) is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned. The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned, but only in the scope where it was declared. The `const` keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned;
- JavaScript has built-in objects and methods that allow you to perform complex tasks with little code or no code at all. For example, the `console.log()` method writes a message to the console, or the `document.getElementById()` method returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value;

## JavaScript loops
- Loops are used to repeat a block of code a number of times. There are three types of loops in JavaScript: `for`, `while` and `do while`;
- for loop: `for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) { code block to be executed }`;
- while loop: `while (condition) { code block to be executed }`;
- do while loop: `do { code block to be executed } while (condition)`;
- for in loop: `for (variable in object) { code block to be executed }`;

## JavaScript functions
- Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are executed when "something" invokes them (calls them);
- Functions are defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses `()`;
- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses `()` in the function definition;
- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked;
- Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables;
- The `return` statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function;
- Functions can be used the same way as you use `Math.max` and `Math.min` methods. For example, `Math.max(0, 150, 30, 20, -8, -200)` returns `150`;
- Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions. Arrow functions are always anonymous. Arrow functions do not have their own `this` value. Arrow functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors;
- Arrow function expression: `const square = (x) => x * x`;
